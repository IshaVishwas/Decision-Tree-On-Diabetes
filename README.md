- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant  
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration  
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)  
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)  
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)  
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function (a score based on family history)  
- `Age`: Age (years)  
- `Outcome`: Target variable (1 indicates diabetes, 0 indicates no diabetes)
